## YUZU

YUZU is a custom assembly language for our quantum machine. It takes the custom source file and turns it into binary instructions that are to be interpreted by an arduino or rpi or smth idfk. These then tell lasers how to shoot photons at particles in a mass shooting event that will certainly go down in history.
